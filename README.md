# Email_Scraper
This Python script is a simple web crawler designed to scan a target URL for email addresses and discover linked pages. It employs libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to parse HTML content, extract email addresses, and follow links to other pages within the same domain. Users can specify a starting URL, and the script iteratively explores web pages, accumulating discovered email addresses along the way. The crawler's depth is limited to prevent extensive web traversal, and it gracefully handles common exceptions, making it a useful tool for basic web scraping tasks.
